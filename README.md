# Portfolio Website Project with Tailwind CSS
This project is about exploring and implementing Tailwind CSS frameworks for building a responsive portfolio website for us. This website builds by integrating Tailwind CSS, JavaScript, and basic Web Hosting. <br>
Duration: 4 weeks
## My Environment and Installation 
My IDE is Visual Studio Code and Tailwind is a utility-first CSS framework that provides pre-built classes to style the elements directly in HTML. JavaScript is used for interactivity, particularly to control the visibility of the mobile navigation menu and handle simple user interactions. The structure of the entire page is built with HTML. Tailwind is used with PostCSS and installed via npm for development and configured through tailwind.config.js and postcss.config.js.
## Project Breakdown
<p>Tailwind Setup via PostCSS enables customs builds that eliminate unused CSS for better performance, theme customization, dark mode control via class, compatibility with additional PostCSS plugins like autoprefixer. In the tailwind.config.js, there’s a config that ensures Tailwind scans all HTML and JS files for class names, applies custom theme and enables animation like morph. Theme customization offer consistent styling across components like cards, button, navigation and section layout via custom color palettes (like primary, secondary and accent), animations such as a morphing blob, and extensions to font families and shadows.</p>

<p>The website layout is structured HTML5 elements like header, section and footer and each section is clearly identified (hero, about, skills, project, contact) to support both accessibility and smooth navigation. Tailwind’s utility classes are used to manage layout via flex, grid and responsive breakpoint like md: and lg:, typography like text-xl and font-bold, and visual effects like shadow-lg, transition-all, hover:-translate-y-1. For responsive design, there’re applied mobile-first approach with layout adjustments that gracefully adapt across screen size.</p>

<p>JavaScript enhance the interactivity throughout the website. Theme toggle implemented by detecting system preferences and storing the user’s choice with localStorage, then dynamically adjusting classes and icon states. A mobile navigation menu is toggled using JavaScript to show and hide it based on button clicks and link selection, while also locking scroll when active. Smooth scrolling to anchor-linked sections was added using JavaScript to account for the fixed header height, providing a fluid navigation experience.</p>

<p>In the contact form, JavaScript handles form submission without a backend (the database can be configured in future development stages.), logging the input, resetting the form, and temporarily changing the submit button’s text to confirm the action. Scroll-based animations are powered by a combination of event listeners and IntersectionObserver, which trigger fade-in and slide-up effects when sections enter the viewport. This includes subtle enhancements like adding a shadow to the header on scroll and animating the hero section’s terminal-style command using a typing effect.</p>
As part of enhancing user interaction, this website integrates Tidio — a cloud-based live chat and chatbot service that allows visitors to communicate with the site owner in real time.
