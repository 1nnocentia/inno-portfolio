# Portfolio Website Project with Tailwind CSS
This project is about exploring and implementing Tailwind CSS frameworks for building a responsive portfolio website for us. This website builds by integrating Tailwind CSS, JavaScript, and basic Web Hosting. <br>
Duration: 4 weeks
## My Environment and Installation 
My IDE is Visual Studio Code and Tailwind is a utility-first CSS framework that provides pre-built classes to style the elements directly in HTML. JavaScript is used for interactivity, particularly to control the visibility of the mobile navigation menu and handle simple user interactions. The structure of the entire page is built with HTML.
Tailwind is used with PostCSS and installed via npm for development and configured through tailwind.config.js and postcss.config.js.
## Project Breakdown
Tailwind Setup via PostCSS enables customs builds that eliminate unused CSS for better performance, theme customization (like colors, fonts and shadows), dark mode control via class, compatibility with additional PostCSS plugins like autoprefixer. In the tailwind.config.js, thereâ€™s a config that ensures Tailwind scans all HTML and JS files for class names, applies custom theme and enables animation like morph.
